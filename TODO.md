```
change require to if condition to make the gass less.
e.g:
Using require:

require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

to Using if with custom error:

error InsufficientBalance(uint256 available, uint256 required);

if (balance < amount) {
    revert InsufficientBalance(balance, amount);
}

1. Setup and Initial Configuration:
   - Clone the scaffold-eth-2 repository and set it up for your project.
   - Customize the configuration to fit RentHub's needs, including network settings for the various blockchains you plan to support (Shibarium, CrossFi, ICP, etc.).

2. Smart Contract Development:
   - Utilize the Solidity environment in scaffold-eth-2 to develop your core smart contracts.
   - Create contracts for:
     - Rental agreements
     - Revenue sharing
     - Token management (if you're implementing a native token)
     - Rating and review system

3. Frontend Development:
   - Leverage the React components provided by scaffold-eth-2.
   - Customize the UI to create the RentHub interface, including:
     - Rental listing pages
     - User profiles
     - Transaction history
     - Rating and review system

4. Web3 Integration:
   - Use the ethers.js integration in scaffold-eth-2 to connect your frontend with the blockchain.
   - Implement functions for interacting with your smart contracts.

5. Multi-chain Support:
   - Extend the template to support multiple chains. You may need to add configuration for chains like Shibarium and CrossFi.
   - Implement chain switching functionality in the UI.

6. Testing:
   - Utilize the Hardhat testing environment provided by scaffold-eth-2 to write and run tests for your smart contracts.

7. Deployment:
   - Use the deployment scripts in scaffold-eth-2 to deploy your contracts to various networks.

8. Additional Features:
   - Integrate external APIs (like GoldRush for analytics) using the frontend's API calling capabilities.
   - If implementing AI features, you may need to add additional backend services, which can be integrated with your scaffold-eth-2 frontend.

9. Security:
   - Leverage scaffold-eth-2's security practices and extend them for RentHub's specific needs.

10. Documentation:
    - Use the README and documentation structure provided by scaffold-eth-2 as a starting point for documenting RentHub.
